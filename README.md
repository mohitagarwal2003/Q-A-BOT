# Q-A-BOT
This project is a full-stack web application that allows users to upload and manage files, interact with a Telegram bot, and query an AI model (via OpenAI API) for responses. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), the app features user authentication with JWT and session management using Redis.
